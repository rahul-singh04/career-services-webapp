## Carrer Services application
 Career Services Applications will assist you with identifying employment opportunities from the Job Market as per the candidate requirement.
 Moreover, it can assist individuals in reaching their employment goals, as well as supporting employers with their recruitment, retention and skills development.
## Project Description
 The fierce competition in the contemporary workplace makes it difficult for people to find a job. In order to help capable job seekers to be seen, and let more employers find their favourite employees, this Career Services Application is going to be developed. The goal of this project is to create a website for job seekers and employers. It can provide students a platform for career services where they can upload and maintain their portfolios and companies can post job openings. This will be quite beneficial for students and companies to reduce the gap between them and help them build a bridge of mutual understanding. 
 
On this recruitment platform, students can modify their resume according to the market needs by learning the latest technology and skills. Employers can continuously post job openings that are needed in their company. In order to access the website, all  students and employers have to first create and then login using their email address and password. Further, students can apply to suitable jobs by uploading their resumes whereas companies can find out the potential job seekers according to their profile. What’s more, employers will receive a notification when any student applies to their job opening and students will be notified when they get selected by an interview respectively. Besides, the platform will also apply multi-factor authentication to provide security from any potential fraud. Ultimately, the purpose of this project is to simplify the job selection in the talent market, so that job seekers can find good opportunities for future development and employers can also recruit for technical talents suitable for their companies. 

To this end, the Agile development method will be applied to this project. By adopting four phases of sprints, incremental development is carried out to reach the final operational application system. In this process, according to the basic principles of Agile, personnel will be allocated reasonably, and fixed communication will alao be arranged to promote understanding of each other’s work process and achieve better cooperation efficiency.

## Project Approach and Technology Stack
### Agile Methodology
Agile Methodology based on development within a short span of time as we have only four sprints to complete this project. Software is developed in increment so changes can be done quickly and it focuses on interaction over tools, maintaining simplicity with minimum documentation. 

### Version Control Software
We have given Github a version control tool to work on our project as it is easy to integrate all the codes and to observe every minute changes in a team. It makes it easy for frontend and backend developers to commit changes. 

### Front End React JS 
Our team has opted to use React as our front end technology since it is simple to understand and apply. Moreover,it provides great community access and documentation which can help any newbie to create web applications. 

### Backend
We chose the younger Node.js Express framework. It can respond to front-end requests with middleware, and perform different request actions through routing tables. Based on the V8 JavaScript runtime environment, it develops faster because its model is lighter and its syntax is simpler.

### Database
As data storage, we decided to use Mongodb as our database. Compared with other databases, its document structure storage method ensures easier access to data. With the built-in distributed file system GridFS, MongoDB can satisfy fast range queries on large data sets. In addition, the sharding design capability of MongoDB can support a maximum of about 20 petabytes, which is enough to support general applications.

## User Stories Backlog
### 1. Student sign up:
As a student who is looking for a job, I want to create my account by entering my details. On clicking the sign up button on the homepage, I can enter details such as Full name, email address and phone number. In this way, the website will check the details and store user data in the database.

### 2. Employee login: 
As an employee, I want to login to the application by clicking the login button on the home page and entering Email id and Password. The system then verifies credentials and if valid, I can proceed.

### 3. Students upload portfolio:
As a graduate student who is about to graduate, after creating my account, I want to edit my portfolio to update my information with new skills or project experiences so that employees will see my new abilities and make me more competitive.
 
### 4. Admin verify job posts:
As a system admin, I want to verify and post each job offer that was added by employees so that students can see the newest job posts and choose to apply.

### 5. Employee post job openings:
As an employee, I want to post my job openings in the public panel with detailed descriptions so that students or job seekers can view on their sides and apply if they are interested.

## Open Issues or plan for Next sprint
 In this round of sprints, we confirmed the important requirements of the project as user stories, formulated technical approaches suitable for our team and built a basic system platform. 
 
 We also encountered many problems. Unfamiliarity with the Node.js express framework will undoubtedly make us spend more time learning this emerging technology on the back end. For the front end, we also have some members who do not have corresponding experience, which also needs to invest time.
 
In addition, we assigned each member some challenging work for future sprints. In the next sprint, we will continue to optimise the results we have now, and gradually implement various functions.First of all, we will improve the corresponding interface for different user identities, such as student, employee and admin. At the same time, adjust the backend to match the frontend data. After each member completes the assigned tasks, we will integrate each branch and test each function. According to the feedback of our test results, we will make plans and adjustments for our next-step.
