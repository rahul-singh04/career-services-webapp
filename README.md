It can provide students a platform for career services where they can upload and maintain their portfolios and companies can post job openings. This will be quite beneficial for students and companies to reduce the gap between them. Also, students can modify their resume according to the market needs by learning the latest technology and skills. In order to access the website, all  students and employers have to first create and then login using their email address and password. Further, Students can edit their profiles and can apply to suitable job profiles whereas companies can find out  the profile of potential job seekers.

## Project Approach and Technology Stack
### Agile Methodology
 Agile Methodology based on development within a short span of time as we have only four sprints to complete this project. Software is developed in increment so changes can be done quickly and it focuses on interaction over tools, maintaining simplicity with minimum documentation.
### Version Control Software
 We have given Github a version control tool to work on our project as it is easy to integrate all the codes and to observe every minute changes in a team. It makes it easy for frontend and backend developers to commit changes. 
### Front End React JS 
 Our team has opted to use React as our front end technology since it is simple to understand and apply. Moreover,it provides great community access and documentation which can help any newbie to create web applications. 
### Backend
 We chose the younger Node.js Express framework. It can respond to front-end requests with middleware, and perform different request actions through routing tables. Based on the V8 JavaScript runtime environment, it develops faster because its model is lighter and its syntax is simpler.
### Database
 As data storage, we decided to use Mongodb as our database. Compared with other databases, its document structure storage method ensures easier access to data. With the built-in distributed file system GridFS, MongoDB can satisfy fast range queries on large data sets. In addition, the sharding design capability of MongoDB can support a maximum of about 20 petabytes, which is enough to support general applications.
